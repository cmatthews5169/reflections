When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you wanted to collaborate with others on a project or even if you wanted to keep a remote backup of all your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	If you were collaborating with others online, someone might have commited changes that you did not want included on your local code yet.
