When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you wanted to collaborate with others on a project or even if you wanted to keep a remote backup of all your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	If you were collaborating with others online, someone might have commited changes that you did not want included on your local code yet. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	A fork is essentially a clone performed on github servers. You would use this when you wanted to give credit to the original author.
	A clone allows you to copy either a remote or local repository to create another local copy. You could use this copy to create major changes to a project where most of the code will be rewritten but still referenced for what might be required. 
	A branch is when you want to create a different path for a project. It can be used for smaller feature changes or additions that you would not want to include in the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	You can use check to see if there have been any changes to the remote since you have last pulled.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	Sharing files manually. You would never have to worry about anyone elses changes affecting yours as it would only be your changes included when sending them the project.  It would be harder to compare changes made to the project by two people or to see the history of changes that happened.
